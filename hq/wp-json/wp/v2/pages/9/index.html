Next step is to copy it to the wp stack on android so that it can be reached from any machine on the local network.  From either stack it can be exported to static and uploaded to GitHub and Gitlab.  It can also be backed up and migrated from one to the other.  LocalWP allows for a a ssh tunnel share link, accessible from the inner webs.  So far it has no problems viewing, but editing has a problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LocalWP is a solid high polish product, but its also free, as in free beer, not freedom.  I believe it runs on Docker, tho there are no docs on that level.  Docker is the beast that quickly swelled with out notice taking up massive space on my macbook, so I treat it with caution.  Because I am pretty sure LocalWP runs on docker, and I had that disk space takeover, I only run it on my old macbook.  To edit HQ with the new macbook, I need HQ running on the android stack.
